# Agglomerative Clustering

This program performs point clustering using agglomerative clustering analysis.
It allows you to generate points, group them into clusters, and visualize the results.

# Usage Example
 
Entry: 
- Centroid
- Starting points: 20
- Number of points 1020
-  Exit condition: no cluster has an average distance of points from the centre of more than 500. - Average Linkage.

Output:
- Time: ~3-5s
